<li1>The group spots a blind man stumbling along the road with a stick.</li1><br/>
<li2>A band of religious ascetics on a pilgrimage to a nearby temple are travelling in the same direction as the party. They all seem unsure about the path ahead.</li2><br/>
<li3>The party sees an old woman with a young girl that is slowly moving towards them. When they come closer, the group notices that the woman is actually blind, and the girl is guiding her</li3><br/>
<li4>There's a dog leashed to a tree. There doesn’t seem to be anyone else around.</li4><br/>
<li5>There is a pair of horses, seemingly abandoned, nearby. a further inspection reveals they are still wearing riding tack and seemed to be abandoned in a hurry.</li5><br/>
<li6>A shepherd with a dozen sheep is trying to guide them through the road.</li6><br/>
<li7>A young man starts to follow the group. He's an incompetent "adventurer" that won't take 'no' for an answer and wants to join them.</li7><br/>
<li8>A hunter approaches, asking for the party's aid. He is gaunt, and obviously hungry.</li8><br/>
<li9>The group sees a man’s corpse in the middle of the road. a young man, no more than eighteen or nineteen. His throat has been cut.</li9><br/>
<li10>A trio of dirty peasants is riding past on an impossibly fancy carriage. They nervously smile and wave at the group.</li10><br/>
<li11>Clouds start to form above and it begins to rain heavily. The party spots a man coming the other way, carrying a heavy umbrella and wearing a trench coat.</li11><br/>
<li12>The party sees a large stone hut nearby with smoke coming out of it's chimney. Every surface of it is covered in protective runes, so it must be immune to magic and weapons. Who could possibly be living here?</li12><br/>
<li13>A dwarf falls from the sky onto the road with a splat.</li13><br/>
<li14>A row of severed heads on spikes are set nearby, and a warning sign claiming, “Dis Rode Belong Negantir”.</li14><br/>
<li15>A band of ragged peasants make half-hearted attempts to pickpocket travellers near a village. Currently, they're trying to get a dwarf to cough up his bag of Auru.</li15><br/>
<li16>A dozen or so boys are playing in a clearing next to the road.</li16><br/>
<li17>A stuck wagon blocks the way forward. The party doesn't see anyone around.</li17><br/>
<li18>Twoscore ragged men and women file by, dirty, their eyes cast down, and their necks chained together in a line, as a slave driver and his men drive them forth to the next city.</li18><br/>
<li19>The characters stumble into an ambush of bandits. The bandits, who are dwarves, elves, and humans, all look confusedly at each other, upon seeing the party.</li19><br/>
<li20>A huge road sign sits at a crossroad, giving distances and directions to hundreds of places, some the party has never heard of.</li20><br/>
<li21>The road suddenly ends. Nothing but wilderness lies beyond.</li21><br/>
<li22>A band of grim-faced guards halt the party at a crossroads while they try to burn the head of a necromancer. The necromancer is still speaking, even though their head has been severed.</li22><br/>
<li23>An ornate carriage has shattered it's wheel and sits by the roadway. Tracks indicate whoever was in the carriage wandered into the forest just up ahead.</li23><br/>
<li24>Many arrowheads pierce the snow, their shafts sticking out at many angles. Closer inspection reveals them to be no common hunting arrow.</li24><br/>
<li25>A frozen stream beside this road is home to a giant and rabid Magikarp that lies in wait for unwary travelers. at least, that's what the sign near the stream says, but the party doesn't see any Magikarp.</li25><br/>
<li26>A scorned woman chases her cheating husband, throwing rocks at him when convenient.</li26><br/>
<li27>A swarm of angry bees chases an ayezi. It's heading right at the party.</li27><br/>
<li28>The group hears the howls of Werewolves echo somewhere nearby...</li28><br/>
<li29>The group hears the growling of an ayezi. It's definitely close...</li29><br/>
<li30>The dark forest that the road travels through contains magical statues that animate and attack when approached.</li30><br/>
<li31>The pary comes across a freshly dug shallow grave by the side of the road.</li31><br/>
<li32>Three women chase a lone man down the road, beating him with brooms. He's half naked and is carrying his clothes while he runs.</li32><br/>
<li33>A girl with blood in her hair sits on a log up ahead.</li33><br/>
<li34>A nondescript traveller asks to travel with the group for safety. If they accept, he starts asking them questions about their lives and where they're headed.</li34><br/>
<li35>All light around the party suddenly turns pitch-black. They can't see a thing.</li35><br/>
<li36>A six-legged dog is eating the carcass of a dwarf. It growls as the group approaches.</li36><br/>
<li37>A small group of men take target practice with crossbows. They turn their bows on the group immediately as they approach.</li37><br/>
<li38>Perfectly positioned in the middle of the road lies a dead body.</li38><br/>
<li39>A small group of men take target practice with crossbows. They express great interest in you and challenge you for a small wager. One of them boasts, "Jarvis here is the best crossbowman on Śnieg."</li39><br/>
<li40>A crazy backwoods seditionist has made up his own country, with its own legal system and economy only he uses. He's a fairly powerful Water Mage, and demands the group to obey his laws before entering "his" territory, which is a small river passing through a forest.</li40><br/>
<li41>Bricks and motor debris litter the roadway as the party nears the clearing of ruined home.</li41><br/>

<li44>A man wearing rags and chains beseeches the party to help them hide.</li44><br/>
<li45>A wagon ahead has overturned. It appears to have been carrying four large metal containers that are now scattered about. The driver lies dead, some wicked pustules marking his exposed skin.</li45><br/>
<li46>An enigmatic pair of monks who refuse to acknowledge the group are on the road, openly talking about a "sacrifice" of some sort.</li46><br/>
<li47>The party feel like they are being followed.</li47><br/>
<li48>A thick rope lies flat on the ground across the road.</li48><br/>
<li49>An empty noose is tied to one of the branches of a tree.</li49><br/>
<li50>A scruffy, twitching man digs a hole in the middle of the road.</li50><br/>
<li51>A lush garden beckons the party with ripe vegetables.</li51><br/>
<li52>As the party passes beneath a large oak that has grown over the road, a branch swoops down and snatches an item from the group. The tree proves vocally petulant when you attempt retrieval, tossing the bag from one branch to another.</li52><br/>
<li53>A lone child blocks the bridge ahead, unless the group can guess her riddle.</li53><br/>
<li54>A strange smell comes from the bushes nearby.</li54><br/>
<li55>A glint of light upon the road draws your gang's attention. A small holy symbol lies in the open, abandoned.</li55><br/>
<li56>SEKSMISJA spots a chicken on one side of the road, looking diffidently at the other side.</li56><br/>
<li57>An exotic, almost alien weapon or tool lies on the side of the road. </li57><br/>

<li59>A wizard is arguing with his broom in the middle of the road.</li59><br/>
<li60>A shrine to a god that the party have never heard of before stands by the roadside. The shrine looks ancient but has been recently cleaned by someone.</li60><br/>
<li61>A strange old man offers the group a book in a language they cannot read.</li61><br/>
<li62>Some sort of festival or pilgrimage in a field beside the road celebrates the holiday of a saint.</li62><br/>
<li63>SEKSMISJA sees someone they loved who had died sitting nearby. None of the other party members can see them.</li63><br/>
<li64>Three animated broadswords weave back and forth against each other in the middle of a steep-sided pass.</li64><br/>
<li65>A lost child cries on the side of the road.</li65><br/>
<li66>A crowd stacks branches around the feet of an old woman tied to a stake. They call for a torch, chanting "WITCH!" and "BURN HER!" in eager and enraged tones.</li66><br/>
<li67>A 7-headed white goose appears, and flaps it's wings in alarm at the party. It starts attacking SEKSMISJA, biting into their feet.</li67><br/>
<li68>A wagon bogged in the mud, with a cursing merchant and harried teamsters.</li68><br/>
<li69>The bodies of dead men, women, and children are scattered across the road. A naked man is biting into their necks, covered from head to toe in blood.</li69><br/>
<li70>A storm approaches, covering the skies with gray clouds. But, instead of rain, blood begins to rain down from the heavens.</li70><br/>
<li71>Crimson blood starts to seep through the road the party is walking on...</li71><br/>
<li72>A small rabbit hops across the road in front of the group.</li72><br/>

<li76>The party hears faint singing nearby. It sounds terrible.</li76><br/>
<li77>SEKSMISJA hears music. None of the other party members can hear it.</li77><br/>
<li78>A gypsy fortune teller travelling through the path offers to read SEKSMISJA's palm, and oddly, she says she'll do so for no charge whatsoever.</li78><br/>
<li79>The local law enforcers of this area stop the party, informing them that the path ahead is dangerous to cross, for a great beast roams it.</li79><br/>
<li80>Two people are arguing over the possession of a pig in a canvas bag.</li80><br/>
<li81>A mass of small birds swoop from the sky and begin murderously pecking and slashing your faces.</li81><br/>
<li82>A field nearby is filled with enormous and mishappen plants that smell faintly of rotting flesh.</li82><br/>

<li91>A bloodied old man cries for help.</li91><br/>
<li92>An old veteran stands on a bridge, staring into the abyss and swinging a spear into the air. They're muttering something about a battle.</li92><br/>
<li93>A thick fog has settled on the bridge ahead.</li93><br/>
<li94>None of the party could remember hearing the wind bellow like a huge beast before, and their yells are quite lost upon it. Then, a massive funnel cloud touches down not one hundred yards before the group. Behind it, two more are visible.</li94><br/>
<li95>The bridge behind the party collapses. There's no way back to safety.</li95><br/>
<li96>Ghouls and zombies emerge from the shadows of the roadside woods. Instead of attacking, the entities wail mysterious warnings to leave the road.</li96><br/>
<li97>A parliament resting on the branches of large trees watches the group walk by.</li97><br/>
<li98>A parliament resting on the branches of large trees watches the group walk by. They all have red, glowing eyes, and don't stop staring at them.</li98><br/>

<li100>An old man sits on a tree stump smoking a pipe.</li100><br/>
