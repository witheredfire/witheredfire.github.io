<li1>The group spots a blind man stumbling along the road with a stick.</li1><br/>
<li2>A band of religious ascetics on a pilgrimage to a nearby temple are travelling in the same direction as the party. They all seem unsure about the path ahead.</li2><br/>
<li3>The party sees an old woman with a young girl that is slowly moving towards them. When they come closer, the group notices that the woman is actually blind, and the girl is guiding her</li3><br/>
<li>There's a dog leashed to a tree. There doesn’t seem to be anyone else around.</li><br/>
<li>There is a pair of horses, seemingly abandoned, nearby. A further inspection reveals they are still wearing riding tack and seemed to be abandoned in a hurry.</li><br/>
<li>A shepherd with a dozen sheep is trying to guide them through the road.</li><br/>
<li>A young man starts to follow the group. He's an incompetent "Adventurer" that won't take 'no' for an answer and wants to join them.</li><br/>
<li>A hunter approaches, asking for the party's aid. He is gaunt, and obviously hungry.</li><br/>
<li>The group sees a man’s corpse in the middle of the road. A young man, no more than eighteen or nineteen. His throat has been cut.</li><br/>
<li>A trio of dirty peasants is riding past on an impossibly fancy carriage. They nervously smile and wave at the group.</li><br/>
<li>Clouds start to form above and it begins to rain heavily. The party spots a man coming the other way, carrying a heavy umbrella and wearing a trench coat.</li><br/>
<li>The party sees a large stone hut nearby with smoke coming out of it's chimney. Every surface of it is covered in protective runes, so it must be immune to magic and weapons. Who could possibly be living here?</li><br/>
<li>A dwarf falls from the sky onto the road with a splat.</li><br/>
<li>A row of severed heads on spikes are set nearby, and a warning sign claiming, “Dis Rode Belong Negantir”.</li><br/>
<li>A band of ragged peasants make half-hearted attempts to pickpocket travellers near a village. Currently, they're trying to get a dwarf to cough up his bag of Auru.</li><br/>
<li>A dozen or so boys are playing in a clearing next to the road.</li><br/>
<li>A stuck wagon blocks the way forward. The party doesn't see anyone around.</li><br/>
<li>Twoscore ragged men and women file by, dirty, their eyes cast down, and their necks chained together in a line, as a slave driver and his men drive them forth to the next city.</li><br/>
<li>The characters stumble into an ambush of bandits. The bandits, who are dwarves, elves, and humans, all look confusedly at each other, upon seeing the party.</li><br/>
<li>A huge road sign sits at a crossroad, giving distances and directions to hundreds of places, some the party has never heard of.</li><br/>
<li>The road suddenly ends. Nothing but wilderness lies beyond.</li><br/>
<li>A band of grim-faced guards halt the party at a crossroads while they try to burn the head of a necromancer. The necromancer is still speaking, even though their head has been severed.</li><br/>
<li>An ornate carriage has shattered it's wheel and sits by the roadway. Tracks indicate whoever was in the carriage wandered into the forest just up ahead.</li><br/>
<li>Many arrowheads pierce the snow, their shafts sticking out at many angles. Closer inspection reveals them to be no common hunting arrow.</li><br/>
<li>A frozen stream beside this road is home to a giant and rabid Magikarp that lies in wait for unwary travelers. At least, that's what the sign near the stream says, but the party doesn't see any Magikarp.</li><br/>
<li>A scorned woman chases her cheating husband, throwing rocks at him when convenient.</li><br/>
<li>A swarm of angry bees chases an Ayezi. It's heading right at the party.</li><br/>
<li>The group hears the howls of Werewolves echo somewhere nearby...</li><br/>
<li>The group hears the growling of an Ayezi. It's definitely close...</li><br/>
<li>The dark forest that the road travels through contains magical statues that animate and attack when approached.</li><br/>
<li>The pary comes across a freshly dug shallow grave by the side of the road.</li><br/>
<li>Three women chase a lone man down the road, beating him with brooms. He's half naked and is carrying his clothes while he runs.</li><br/>
<li>A girl with blood in her hair sits on a log up ahead.</li><br/>
<li>A nondescript traveller asks to travel with the group for safety. If they accept, he starts asking them questions about their lives and where they're headed.</li><br/>
<li>All light around the party suddenly turns pitch-black. They can't see a thing.</li><br/>
<li>A six-legged dog is eating the carcass of a dwarf. It growls as the group approaches.</li><br/>
<li>A small group of men take target practice with crossbows. They turn their bows on the group immediately as they approach.</li><br/>
<li>Perfectly positioned in the middle of the road lies a dead body.</li><br/>
<li>A small group of men take target practice with crossbows. They express great interest in you and challenge you for a small wager. One of them boasts, "Jarvis here is the best crossbowman in the kingdom."</li><br/>
<li>A crazy backwoods seditionist has made up his own country, with its own legal system and economy only he uses. He's a fairly powerful Water Mage, and demands the group to obey his laws before entering "his" territory, which is a small river passing through a forest.</li><br/>
<li>Bricks and motor debris litter the roadway as the party nears the clearing of ruined home.</li><br/>
<li>The party is startled by a raven flying overhead that caws out one SEKSMISJA's name.</li><br/>
<li>Pilgrims of differing faiths and races brawl near the road.</li><br/>
<li> </li><br/>
