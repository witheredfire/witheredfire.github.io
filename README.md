   <p align=center>Welcome to the Writer's Archives! This is a little site I made two years ago to host lists of events for RNGsus, a Discord bot designed to assist in roleplay and D&D.</p>
  <p align=center>I had decided to move the site to repl.it for my convenience, since I found it easier to edit the site from there. I then proceeded to abandon the project entirely due to my studies and preoccupations. Fortunately for old Jeezy, I've decided to continue my little project, and chose to move to Github since I'm currently doing all of this on mobile.</p>
  <p align=center>TL;DR this is a site for a bot to grab lists from.</p>
